            <p>I am a PhD student at the University of Glasgow, where I am focused on large-scale sequential recommender
                systems. My research interests include recommender systems, information retrieval,
                and deep learning in general, and I have authored
                or co-authored more than four publications in these areas.
                My PhD supervisors are <a href="https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~craigm/">Prof. Craig Macdonald</a> and
                <a href="https://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~ounis/"> Prof. Iadh Ounis</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Before pursuing my PhD, I worked for 10 years as a software engineer,
                including as a senior software engineer at Amazon.com, where I worked primarily on recommendations,
                personalisation, search, and personalised online advertising. While I was not a researcher at the time,
                I gained extensive experience with recommender systems and related areas.</p>
            <p>In addition to my academic and professional work, I have also supervised master's
                student projects on recommender systems at the University of Edinburgh, and have
                taught machine learning and data analysis in online and offline courses in Russian.
                In my free time, I enjoy driving around Scotland, studying languages, and reading fantasy books.</p>

                        <p>BERT4Rec is an effective model for sequential recommendation based on the Transformer
                            architecture. In the original publication, BERT4Rec claimed superiority over other
                            available sequential recommendation approaches (e.g. SASRec), and it is now frequently
                            being used as a state-of-the art baseline for sequential recommendations. However, not
                            all subsequent publications confirmed this result and proposed other models that were
                            shown to outperform BERT4Rec in effectiveness. In this paper we systematically review
                            all publications that compare BERT4Rec with another popular Transformer-based model,
                            namely SASRec, and show that BERT4Rec results are not consistent within these publications.
                            To understand the reasons behind this inconsistency, we analyse the available
                            implementations of BERT4Rec and show that we fail to reproduce results of the original
                            BERT4Rec publication when using their default configuration parameters. However, we are
                            able to replicate the reported results with the original code if training for a much
                            longer amount of time (up to 30x) compared to the default configuration. We also propose
                            our own implementation of BERT4Rec based on the Hugging Face Transformers library, which
                            we demonstrate replicates the originally reported results on 3 out 4 datasets, while
                            requiring up to 95% less training time to converge. Overall, from our systematic review
                            and detailed experiments, we conclude that BERT4Rec does indeed exhibit state-of-the-art
                            effectiveness for sequential recommendation, but only when trained for a sufficient
                            amount of time. Additionally, we show that our implementation can further benefit from
                            adapting other Transformer architectures that are available in the Hugging Face
                            Transformers library (e.g. using disentangled attention, as provided by DeBERTa, or larger
                            hidden layer size cf. ALBERT).</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Many modern sequential recommender systems use deep neural networks, which can effectively
                            estimate the relevance of items but require a lot of time to train. Slow training
                            increases expenses, hinders product development timescales and prevents the model
                            from being regularly updated to adapt to changing user preferences. Training such
                            sequential models involves appropriately sampling past user interactions to create a
                            realistic training objective. The existing training objectives have limitations. For
                            instance, next item prediction never uses the beginning of the sequence as a learning
                            target, thereby potentially discarding valuable data. On the other hand, the item masking
                            used by BERT4Rec is only weakly related to the goal of the sequential recommendation;
                            therefore, it requires much more time to obtain an effective model. Hence, we propose a
                            novel Recency-based Sampling of Sequences training objective that addresses both
                            limitations. We apply our method to various recent and state-of-the-art model architectures
                            - such as GRU4Rec, Caser, and SASRec. We show that the models enhanced with our method can
                            achieve performances exceeding or very close to stateof-the-art BERT4Rec, but with much
                            less training time.</p>

                            datasets, such as MovieLens or Netflix, our dataset is based on the implicit interactions
                            registered at the watching time, rather than on explicit ratings. We also provide rich
                            contextual and side information including interactions characteristics (such as temporal
                            information, watch duration and watch percentage), user demographics and rich movies

                            systems challenge that was based on this dataset - and provide an overview of the best
                            performing solutions of the winners. We keep the competition sandbox open, so the
                            researchers are welcome to try their own recommendation algorithms and measure the

                            model for candidates re-ranking. Our method was inspired by listwise learning-to-rank

                            useful information, while using search engines is presented.
                            Here we mean the systematization of search results according
                            to user’s interests, and also showing advertisement which
                            could be interesting for the user. We introduce concept of
                            "user profile", consisting of keywords/terms, reflecting user
                            interests. The discovering of such keywords is done by parsing
                            user queries and visited websites. The proposed method uses a
                            tree of categories linked to related websites and to the
                            advertising. From these websites we retrieve primary
                            keywords characterizing categories. The primary keywords
                            are extended with new associated ones (called secondary)
                            which were obtained by the methods of distributive semantics.
                            By comparing keywords of user's profile and keywords of the
                            categories we determine relevant categories and useful
                            information (including advertising). The use of distributional
                            semantics methods allows us to obtain good results even on
